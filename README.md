# Subway Seat exchange Decentralized Application - ServeWay

This application is subway seat exchange dApp. There is missing information when people use public-transportation, especially subway. In ServeWay, people can deal the information - When the person in front gets off.

In Serve Way, User can get a seat **in two ways** :

- Real-time matching: If user click “request a seat concession” button,  it will send a push notification to other users who have registered their seats and  match.
- Find and request: If other users sitting on the seats registered there seats, you can find them on “Find" tab. and just send a request. when seat changed → transaction occurs
